## Basic concepts to test
* Inheritance
  * Polymorphysm 
  * Multiple base classes

## Basic theory
* Preprocessor
* Compilation
* Linking
* Static polymorphysm vs dynamic
* Interface vs abstract class
* Inheritance vs composition
* Reference vs Aggregation
* Exceptions. How do they work? What's guaranteed?
* nullptr, why is it needed?
* Why nullptr_t is needed?
* Pointers, pointer arithmetic


# Basic practical questions
---
* Composition?
* Default arguments values.
* Type promotion. Specific cases of char->int->long etc.
* NULL vs nullptr. Type overload for void *.
* non-virtual destructor
* operator overloading
* missing virtual in method of a base class, but present in the subclass
* unique address of a member guarantee (empty class case)
* sizeof
* sizeof abstract/interface
* casts: static, dynamic, reinterpret, etc
* friends
* const in argument declaration: `const char * const arg` does makes sense?


### Modifying object copy retrieved from a container
### Method overloading

### Base class method call
### Diamond inheritance
### Virtual method call in base class ctor
### Member variable hiding in the base class
### Duck typing. Multiple inheritance.

### Logical operator no short-circuit evaluation for overloads

## Understanding stack
Recursive stack allocation (runnding out of stack)

# Understanding linkage
extern vs static vs member vs global variable


## Polymorphism
